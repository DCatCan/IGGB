This study presents the development of a gene visualization
tool called Input Generated Gene Browser aimed at
providing a user friendly gene browser. The tool addresses
the limitations of some gene browsers by letting users input
their own data for visualization. The focus of the tool is on
visualizing genomes, which represents the presence of
multiple genes on the same chromosome. The tool utilizes
pillars and tracks, where pillars represent homologous genes
and tracks represent genome segments. The visualization
algorithms employed in the tool allow for the analysis of
gene order and synteny. The implementation of the tool
utilizes the React framework and Next.js, with deployment
facilitated by Vercel. The results demonstrate the successful
creation of a gene browser with user friendly features for
visualizing genetic information. The tool would offer
flexibility and usability for bioinformatics and scientists to
take advantage of.
